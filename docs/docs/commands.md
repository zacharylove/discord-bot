## Wordle Commands
Commands related to the word puzzle game Wordle. Only some of these commands are tied to the **Wordle** feature.

### Play Wordle
```
/playwordle public:[true/false] infinite:[true/false] puzzlenum:<number> silent:[true/false] challenge:[true/false]
```
Opens a thread in the current channel where the member(s) can play a game of Wordle. A word is selected from the Wordle word list (unless challenge mode is enabled), and any 5-letter word sent to the thread is considered a guess. 

This does not affect users' Wordle statistics.

After the game ends, the results are posted to the original channel and the thread is deleted.

##### Arguments
 - `public` - When `true`, allows anyone to make guesses in the thread. Displays the username next to each guess, but only the user that guesses the answer correctly gets credit at the end.
 - `infinite` - When `true`, allows the player(s) to make an infinite number of guesses. Helpful when in challenge mode.
 - `puzzlenum` - Define a specific puzzle number to play.
 - `silent` - When `true`, does not post the puzzle results to chat after the game ends.
 - `challenge` - When `true`, selects a 5-letter word from the entire English dictionary instead of using the Wordle word set. This results in some esoteric and challenging puzzles.

### Wordle Statistics
```
/wordlestats <user>
```
Generates a card for a given user's Wordle statistics, based off results previously pasted in chat. Includes their global ranking, weighted score, number of puzzles attempted and completed, and average guesses per game.


### Wordle Ranking (Disabled)
```
/wordleranking
```
Displays a global leaderboard of Wordle players, based on their weighted score.
